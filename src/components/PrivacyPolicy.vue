    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 21st August 2024</p>
    
    <h2>1.0 - What information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      The Digital Health Division (DHD) of the Ministry of Health (MoH) Malawi, hereinafter referred to as DHD-MoH, gathers two types of information through its mobile and web versions of the Malawi Healthcare Information System (MaHIS) apps (Electronic Immunization Registry [EIR], Adult Emergency Trauma Centre, eRegister, Outpatient Department [OPD]):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</li>
      <li>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.1 Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
    <p>
      PII is information that identifies or can identify you as an individual, such as, but not limited to; Health Identity number, Phone Number(s), email address(es), Name(s), physical address(es).
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)</h3>
    <p>
      Non-PII includes, but is not limited to, Firebase Cloud Messaging tokens, Firebase IDs, IP addresses (both private and public), hardware models, operating system information, software versions, browser information, flight number, vehicle registration number, ship number and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.
    </p>

    <h4>1.2.1 Device Information</h4>
    <p>We collect information about but not limited to the computers, mobile phones, tablet devices, wearable devices, smart TVs, smart devices and any other web-connected devices that use our Apps or integrate with them. This data is combined across different devices
that you use. This information is used but not limited to enhancing your user experience,
improving features that are device and / or software specific, solving bugs caused by the
behaviour of different devices, fraud detection, software update choices amongst others.</p>

    <h4>1.2.1.1 Device Attributes</h4>
    <p>Information such as operating system, hardware manufacturer, and hardware model name/number, software versions (of our Apps and dependencies).</p>

    <h4>1.2.1.2 Network and Connections</h4>
    <p>Information such as the name of the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) or Internet Service Provider (ISP), private and/or public Internet Protocol (IP) Address, connection speed, and information about other devices that are nearby or on your network.</p>

    <h2>2.0 - How Information We Collect Is Used</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
    <p>
      This aggregate information is used as but not limited to usage statistics which help us track the number of people using the apps, which information is being viewed the most on the apps. Aggregate information may be used in any way approved by the Digital Health Division for trend analyses and analytics that are not yet specified in this policy. In some
instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII. If we combine any Non-PII with PII, the
combined information will be treated as PII. This "combined" PII is not shared with third
parties and is mainly used for analytical purposes which help us improve our Services.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
    <h4>2.2.1 Apps and Sites</h4>
    <p>
      Our Apps comply with applicable privacy and security laws of countries where the Services are designed and <b>officially</b> distributed. Please note that such sharing may involve the collection, use, storage, or disclosure of PII outside the Republic of Malawi.
    </p>

    <h4>2.2.2 Communications</h4>
    <p>We use your PII to send you information related but not limited to the Apps and/or apps installed on your device. This information may be in the form of push notifications delivered
via any Cloud Messaging service that we use at any given time. In certain circumstances,
we may contact the user directly via their email address(es) and/or phone number(s) to
confirm validity and/or receipt of the information.</p>

    <h4>2.2.3 Administrative Matters</h4>
    <p>
      The Digital Health Division reserves the right to contact you in the event of a change in the Ministry of Health’s Privacy Policy or to notify you of other administrative matters in
connection with any of our Apps and/or services that you are currently using or have once
used. It is the responsibility of the user to provide us with accurate information and to make
sure that any changes are understood.
    </p>

    <h4>2.2.4 Other Purposes</h4>
    <p>We may disclose your information:</p>
    <h4>2.2.4.1</h4>
    <p>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request
for cooperation from law enforcement or another government agency; to establish or
exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In
such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</p>
<h4>2.2.4.2</h4>
    <p>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate,
prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing;
to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our
employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or
to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</p>
<h4>2.2.4.3</h4>
    <p>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the reorganisation or sale
of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of
bankruptcy.</p>
    <h2>3.0 - App Permissions</h2>
    <p>The mobile apps make use of user permissions in order to perform functionalities as needed:</p>
    <h3>3.1 - Camera Permission</h3>
    <p>The Apps make use of Camera Permissions on Android devices to perform the following functions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scan Quick Response (QR) code containing client details on national identity cards
          and birth certificates.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>4.0 - Security of Your PII</h2>
    <p>Digital Health Division employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard
industry practice, for PII collected through any of our Apps, including physical, electronic
and operational measures to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access. While the
Digital Health Division takes all appropriate steps to safeguard PII under our control,
unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of storing data can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As such, we cannot guarantee that PII & Non-PII supplied
by users will not be accessed on our servers, or intercepted while being transmitted to us
over the Internet. We assume no liability for any damages you may suffer as a result of
interception, alteration or misuse of information during such transfers. If you have reason
to believe that there has been any breach of the security of any of our Apps and/or servers,
please contact us immediately at software-developers@kuunika.org</p>
<p>We know it is very important to protect the information you share with us. We take
appropriate data and information security measures to help safeguard this information
from unauthorised access and disclosure. For example, only authorised employees /
consultants / teams are allowed access to Digital Health Division's servers and with
appropriate privileges only. Once a UID has been generated, it is used between the
application(s) and the server without the need of passing PII. Cloud Messaging tokens are
refreshed on a regular basis to avoid intrusion via unnecessary push notifications that
could be used by a hacker who has obtained the list of tokens and access key. SSL
certificates have been installed on all our servers. We make use of symmetric cryptography
to secure data passed in between our Apps.</p>
<p>However, <i>security is a process and not a product</i> and no system can be completely secure,
  we design our Apps with information security as one of the priorities.</p>
<h2>5.0 - Offline vs. Online practices</h2>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy applies solely to our online information gathering and
dissemination practices in connection with our Apps, and does not apply to any of our
practices conducted offline.</p>
<h2>6.0 - Use of Our Apps by Children</h2>
<p>Our Apps are not directed to individuals under the age of sixteen (16) without parental
consent, and we request that such individuals do not provide PII through any of our Apps. If
a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally
identifiable information without the parent or guardian’s consent by, for example,
misrepresenting his or her age, that parent or guardian should contact us at
softwaredevelopers@kuunika.org. If the Digital Health Division determines that it has collected personal information of children under the age of 13, Digital Health Division will
immediately delete such information and any accounts believed to be held by children
under 13.</p>
<h2>7.0 - Accessing, Updating or Deleting Information Collected About You</h2>
<p>Digital Health Division has the right to change any information pertaining to the user, both
PII and Non-PII under certain circumstances which warrant such a change as determined
by internal team(s) without giving notice to the user. Some information is collected
automatically by our Apps and as such it is able to detect a change made by the user and
carry out an automatic update. Please note that although this information will not be
available on our Apps after you cease to use them, the information may remain stored
indefinitely on our servers, both main and backup, and as such we cannot always ensure
that these corrections or deletions will reach such other storage facilities in a timely
manner.</p>
<h2>8.0 - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679</h2>
<p>Digital Health Division complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR EU
2016/679) for users who are using our Services and/or Apps and are residents and/or
citizens of the countries mentioned in this regulation. Digital Health Division as the
Controller of data, reserves the right to store, process, analyse, delete, share, transfer and
any other operations deemed fit for business operations and in accordance with this
Privacy Policy and best Business Practices.</p>
<p>Data processors working with the Digital Health Division strictly adhere to its policies and
guidelines towards the usage, processing and analysing of our shared data. And as such,
any data processors found and/or reported to be in breach of our Data Privacy Policy
immediately have their Third Party access revoked after a procedural review.</p>
<p>Data subjects have the right to request for their user data to be exported to the Data subject
  or deleted from our main operational server on which the Service/App is in use.</p>
